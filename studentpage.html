                <p>During most part of my life I've been used to 'go out' to do something.
                    From hiking in the hills to seakayak paddling in the ocean, including rock climbing 
                    in my surroundings, ice climbing abroad or mushroom picking anything is a good excuse 
                    to 'go out'.

                <p>Another of my passions is to stay at home peacefully ( probably after being out) with 
                    my beloved ones either doing nothing or gardening for a while, either helping
                    boys with their homework, or just staying together silently. I love growing my own 
                    vegetables or repairing broken things and preparing the garden to enjoy it in summertime.

                <p>Cooking probably could be fitted on the previous chapter, but in fact that 
                    activity has it' s own entity since many times I do it just for practice o f
                    or taste myself, it' s because of that I decided to place my interest on
                     cooking inside it's own 'article'.
